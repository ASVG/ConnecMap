# parcellation_project

Ensembles of algorithms to build the connectivity-based parcellation schemes:
project.py: code of the class ParcellationProject

plotting.py: various plotting functions to visualize results


In /split:
decide_split.py: functions to evaluates the need to split a structures and the different
algorithms involved in the splitting process.

tuning.py: various functions to choose the different algorithms' parameters.

visualize_split.py: Plot the resulting split region.


In /analyses:
flatmaps.py: Functions to evaluate the connectivity structure within individual regions. Also some
algorithms useful for the splitting process.

parcellation.py: Functions to have a global appreciation of the resulting scheme with respect to another.
